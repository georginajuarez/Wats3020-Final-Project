# Wats3020-Final-Project


####Concept:
I'm going to create a product page for a local company (Big Twin Lake Campground). 
This page will serve as a mockup for a site that could potentially be launch a as a real site.
The idea is to make the site responsive using bootstrap. I want to use the bootstrap tabs function to separate content.
BTLC is a small family company so the page needs to be simple and user friendly.

####Design Plan:
Features:
* Image crousel for landing page
* Map for directions page
* Maybe a contact form 
(but I don't know the setup so I may not include the form and opt for text and an email and add actual form later)

List of third party libraries I plan to use:
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* Mapping library
* Flickr (potentially for images)
